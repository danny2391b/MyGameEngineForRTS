**#My 3D Game Engine**
A simple 3D game engine built from scratch to learn the fundamentals of graphics, physics, and game development.

**Introduction**
Welcome to the repository for my 3D game engine! This engine is being developed as a personal project to learn how 3D rendering, physics, and game development work from the ground up. The goal of this project is to create a simple, extensible 3D engine with a focus on performance and flexibility.

**Features**
To Do:
3D Rendering: Render basic 3D objects (e.g., cubes, spheres, and models).

Camera System: Basic free-roaming camera to navigate 3D space.

Lighting: Directional light, point light, and basic shadows.

Object Loading: Import 3D models (OBJ, FBX) and display them in the scene.

Basic Physics: Simple gravity and collision detection.

More advanced lighting effects (ambient, specular, etc.).

Terrain Generation for creating large outdoor environments.

AI integration for basic enemy pathfinding.

Sound and music integration.

**Usage**
Once you have the engine set up, you can use the following features:

Camera Controls: Use WASD to move the camera or the mouse to look around.

Object Manipulation: Press the space bar to load a test model.

Shadows: Shadows will be automatically enabled if the light source is positioned properly.

**Roadmap**
Planned Features:
More advanced lighting effects (Point, Spot, and Area lights).

Implement real-time physics with an engine like Bullet or PhysX.

Create an editor for easier game development.

Support for more file formats (e.g., Collada, glTF).

Things to Improve:
Optimize performance for large environments.

Add more collision types (sphere, box, etc.).

Implement audio (sound effects and background music).

**Contributing**
If you would like to contribute to this project, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. I'm always looking for feedback and suggestions to improve the engine.
